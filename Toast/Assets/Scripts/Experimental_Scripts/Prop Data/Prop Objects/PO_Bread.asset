  displayName: Bread
  description: "\tBread can be eaten, frozen, toasted, or even lit on fire. You can
    find additional bread in the Fridge. It can be given to Little Fella and he will
    eat it.\n\tThis slice of bread is still warm, having been freshly baked this
    morning. It gives off a savory, toasty aroma, and is fluffy to the touch.\n\tThis
    bread was made with the finest wheat available, hand ground into flour, then
    meticulously kneaded into the perfect shape. Baked at 350 degrees to a crisp
    golden brown."
